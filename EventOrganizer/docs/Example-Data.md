## Blazor WebAssembly vs Angular

Which of these two powerful client-side technologies should you choose for your next project? Learn the strengths and weaknesses of Blazor WebAssembly vs. Angular as Lee experienced them while building typershark.io, a multi-player game in Blazor. Lee will compare and contrast across 10 categories:

* View Typing
* Component Level CSS
* Validation
* Tooling
* Maturity
* Language
* Debugging
* Testability
* Interop, and
* Code Sharing

to help you decide which technology is right for your next project.

## C# 9 and .Net 5 Newness

The upcoming features for C#9 was just released and it comes with some really cool new features to help simplify and reduce boilerplate in your code. In this session, we will do a deep dive into many of these features that will be released along with .Net 5 We will do some practical demos on how you can start leveraging these features in your code today and what to expect in the future from both C#9 and .Net 5. In addition, we will cover scenarios for CI/CD using Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions.

## Writing High-Performance C# and .NET Code

In this session, you'll learn how to write C# code which executes faster and allocates less. This session is packed with practical examples and demos of where the latest high-performance APIs and language features can be applied in your applications.

During this session, we'll apply types such as Span and Memory to efficiently process data and to parse strings. We'll examine System.IO.Pipelines, offering high-performance I/O and we'll utilise ArrayPool to help reduce GC allocations. In .NET Core 3.0, we have new high-performance JSON APIs which we'll also add to our arsenal. Microsoft has made fantastic performance gains to the .NET Core framework; now it's time to apply them to your code!

We'll begin by discussing when and why performance matters in your applications. You'll learn how to measure your code, and use a data-driven approach to focus your optimisations.

These features can seem complicated, unapproachable and difficult to apply. In this session, Steve introduces high-performance newcomers to the features, showing you how they work, where they can be applied and how to measure performance improvements in your code.

This talk is for developers, who like Steve, are ready to begin their journey towards writing faster .NET code, which allocates less.

This talk is aimed at all levels of .NET Core developers. It's intended to provide real-world experience of applying high-performance techniques to .NET code. It shares the journey and experience of a relative performance novice, learning about these features for the first time to solve real problems and optimise code. The audience will leave this talk with the knowledge to begin leveraging performance features and inspired to try them in their code.
